Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook on localhost:9009

To do:
- Add `id` to Details
- Decrease number of letters in cards (limitation)
- Rethink `min-height` of card
- Add `key-frames` animations for components in pages
- Stylize `Details.js` after adding `axios`
- Add default props in `Card.stories.js` and `Details.stories.js`
- Add `permissions` to dashboard if necessary
- Remove `Redirect` from `App.js`
- How to deal with transactions and `transactions/id` for user?
- Add `404` view when user visit route different than in routes
- Add service when user try to visit `logout` without `login`

In the future:
- Add validation of up-to-date transactions
- Maybe... Should I rename `User.js` on `LoginUser.js`?
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
- Maybe.. Should I use `media-query`? But with styled-components?
