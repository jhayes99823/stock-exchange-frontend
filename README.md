Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Add default `right border` for icons
- Add place to `created` and `modified date` for articles, notes and transactions
- Maybe... I should rename `Main` on `MainTemplate`?
- Maybe... I should change path `/dashboard` on `/`?
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
