Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Create Logo component
- Create Loading component
- Divide actions into files
- Delete animations
- Add possibility to `edit` note
- Add `toasts` after: correct registration, adding/edit/remove item

In the future:
- Think about `constant` names and locations
- Add validation in `Formik`
- Add validation of `up-to-date transactions`
- Create components for repeating components, for example `Logo`,

Issues:
- Error handling (500)
- Reset form
