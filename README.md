Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Add possibility to `edit` note
- Add `toasts` after: correct registration, adding/edit/remove item

In the future:
- Think about constant names and locations
- Add validation in Formik
- Add validation of up-to-date transactions

Issues:
- Error handling (500)
- Reset form
