Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook on localhost:9009

To do:
- Stylize `Loading bar` and create component form it
- Create `Form.js` controller
- Add `404` view when user visit route different than described in routes
- Add possibility to `edit` note
- Check out `isLoading` path and `required` in Notes.js and Article.js

In the future:
- Add loading when note or article is deleting
- Think about names of constants
- Add `key-frames` animations for components in pages
- Add validation in Formik
- Add validation of up-to-date transactions
- Clean `Details.js`
