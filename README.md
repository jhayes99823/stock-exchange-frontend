Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook on localhost:9009

To do:
- Create `Wrapper` component for all of user's pages
- Change nomenclature to `Styled`
- Stylize `pages`
- Add place to `created` and `modified date` for articles, notes and transactions

Later:
- Maybe... Should I rename `User.js` on `LoginUser.js`?
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
- Maybe.. Should I use `media-query`? But with styled-components?
