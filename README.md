Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook on localhost:9009

To do:
- Stylize `Details.js`
- Remove `Paragraph`?
- Add possibility to `remove` note and article
- Decrease number of letters in cards (limitation)
- Rethink `min-height` of card
- Add `404` view when user visit route different than described in routes

In the future:
- Add `permissions` to dashboard if necessary (id)
- Add service when user try to visit `logout` without `login`
- Remove `Redirect` from `App.js`
- Add `key-frames` animations for components in pages
- Add validation of up-to-date transactions
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
