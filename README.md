Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Add default `right border` for icons
- Add place to `created` and `modified date` for articles, notes and transactions
- Maybe... Should I rename `Main.js` on `MainTemplate.js`?
- Maybe... Should I rename `Root.js` on `App.js`?
- Maybe... Should I change path `/dashboard` on `/`?
- Maybe... Should I remove `display: block;` selector from `Icon.js`?
- Maybe... Should I rename `User.js` on `LoginUser.js`?
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
- Maybe.. Should I use `media-query`? But with styled-components?
