Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Add default `right border` for icons
- Add place to `created` and `modified date` for articles, notes and transactions
- Maybe... I should rename `Main.js` on `MainTemplate.js`?
- Maybe... I should rename `Root.js` on `App.js`?
- Maybe... I should change path `/dashboard` on `/`?
- Maybe... I should remove `display: block;` selector from `Icon.js`?
- Maybe... I should rename `User.js` on `LoginUser.js`?
- Maybe... I should move `pages` and `templates` to `components`?
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
- Set vertical align for `Sidebar` component
