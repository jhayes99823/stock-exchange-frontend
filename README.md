Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook on localhost:9009

To do:
- Rethink `min-height` of card 

In the future:
- Change nomenclature to `Styled`
- Maybe... Should I rename `User.js` on `LoginUser.js`?
- Add possibility of `log out` (also on backend repository)
- Maybe.. Should I use `media-query`? But with styled-components?
