Frontend:
- `npm i` to install packages
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Create new `Accordion.js`
- Division by zero in `EMV` and `RSI`, `%R`

In the future:
- Remove unused `Wrapper`s
- Rename `Chart` to `BarChart` and `Graph` to `LineChart` or something like that
