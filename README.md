Frontend:
- `react-scripts start` to run frontend on localhost:3000

To do:
- Add possibility to `edit` note
- Remove fields after submit in `Register.js` and (optional) add/edit item
- Add `toasts` after: correct registration, adding/edit/remove item
- Add `404` view when user visit route different than described in routes

In the future:
- Think about names of constants
- Add validation in Formik
- Add validation of up-to-date transactions
- Think about item numbers
