- Decrease number of letters in cards (limitation)
- Rethink `min-height` of card
- Add `404` view when user visit route different than described in routes

In the future:

- Think about names of constants
- Add `permissions` to dashboard if necessary (id)
- Add service when user try to visit `logout` without `login`
- Add service double logout
